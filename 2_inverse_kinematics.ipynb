    "# Inverse kinematics\n",
    "This notebook considers the problem of inverse kinematics, ie solving at each control cycle of the robot a quadratic program from the derivatives (jacobian) of the current state. It introduces the basic function to compute the Jacobians of the robot, and how to use them to compute an inverse-kinematics control law. One of the key difficulties is to understand in which frames each quantities is computed (might be in the world frame, in the local frame attached to the end effector, in some arbitrary goal frame, etc), as we should never mixed quantities expressed in different frames without transporting them in the right frame. \n"
